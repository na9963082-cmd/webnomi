# Simple Contact Form Setup (Web3Forms)

## ✅ Much Easier - Only 2 Steps!

### Step 1: Get Your Access Key (2 minutes)

1. Go to [https://web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com)
2. Enter your email: **nomigrowthengine@gmail.com**
3. Click "Create Access Key"
4. Check your email and **copy the Access Key** they send you

### Step 2: Add the Key to Your Website

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find this line (around line 264):
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE" />
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with the key from your email
4. Save the file

**That's it!** 🎉

## How It Works

- When someone submits the form, Web3Forms sends the message to **nomigrowthengine@gmail.com**
- You'll receive an email with the person's name, email, and message
- It's 100% free for up to 250 submissions per month

## Example

If your access key is `abc123-def456-ghi789`, the line should look like:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="abc123-def456-ghi789" />
```

**Much simpler than the previous method!** 😊
